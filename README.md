# Taming the heterogeneous dynamics in ocean chlorophyll-a concentration prediction with a deep learning model
In this paper, we present STD-Hunter to facilitate long-term, large scale chlorophyll-a concentration prediction. The core innovation is that STD-Hunter forms a predictive model for each task by integrating commonly shared basis models with the specific spatiotemporal characteristics of Chl_a.  STD-Hunter strikes an optimal balance between effectively leveraging data and preserving idiosyncratic dynamics, offering a interpretable tool with for heterogeneous data exploration.
